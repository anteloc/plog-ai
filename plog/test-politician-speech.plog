# Realistic speech example: A politician making contradictory claims
# This represents a transcript where someone's statements don't add up

ATOM taxes_will_decrease: "Taxes will decrease for everyone"
ATOM services_will_improve: "Public services will improve"
ATOM no_new_borrowing: "There will be no new government borrowing"
ATOM economy_is_struggling: "The economy is currently struggling"

# Reasoning: If taxes decrease and no borrowing, then services can't improve
# (less money coming in = less money to spend)
FORMULA budget_reality: (taxes_will_decrease & no_new_borrowing) -> ~services_will_improve

# But the speaker also promised services WILL improve
FORMULA service_promise: economy_is_struggling -> services_will_improve
