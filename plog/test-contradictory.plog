# Test case: Contradictory reasoning (should fail)
# The speaker makes contradictory claims about Socrates

ATOM socrates_is_man: "Socrates is a man"
ATOM socrates_is_mortal: "Socrates is mortal"
ATOM socrates_is_immortal: "Socrates is immortal"

# Reasoning 1: Being a man implies mortality
FORMULA men_are_mortal: socrates_is_man -> socrates_is_mortal

# Reasoning 2: But the speaker also claims Socrates is immortal because he's wise
FORMULA wisdom_grants_immortality: socrates_is_man -> socrates_is_immortal

# Reasoning 3: Mortality and immortality are mutually exclusive
FORMULA mortality_exclusion: socrates_is_mortal -> ~socrates_is_immortal
