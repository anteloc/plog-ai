# Test case: Self-contradictory formula
# The speaker makes a logically impossible statement

ATOM it_is_raining: "It is raining"
ATOM ground_is_wet: "The ground is wet"

# Valid reasoning
FORMULA rain_wets_ground: it_is_raining -> ground_is_wet

# Self-contradictory: "It's raining and not raining" - impossible statement
FORMULA confused_claim: it_is_raining & ~it_is_raining
