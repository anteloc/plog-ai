Everyone knows that the new recycling plan will bankrupt our town. If we allow this, next they'll ban cars! The proposal is backed by scientists, but they're all biased because they want grant money. After all, my neighbor, a very honest man, said it’s a scam. We must reject it, because the only alternative is watching our community fall into ruin. Supporters are either deeply misinformed or secretly hate local businesses. This is a simple choice between common sense and total disaster. Clearly, if we don’t act now, we have already accepted the downfall of our way of life.
