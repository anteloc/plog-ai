Mrs. Jane Doe (European Union): I have the honour to speak on behalf of the
European Union and its Member States. I will read a shortened version of the
European Union’s statement, and the full version will be submitted in writing.
At the beginning of this process, we stressed the unique opportunity we had in
front of us with this process, not just to reinvigorate multilateralism and work towards
the turbocharging the Sustainable Development Goals, but also to rebuild trust and
overcome polarization among us. Through the excellent work of our co-facilitators,
your leadership, Mr. President, and all our collective efforts to seek ambition and
compromise, we believe we have succeeded. Across the action days, the Summit of
the Future’s general debate and its interactive dialogues, we have heard clear
reaffirmation of our global commitment to multilateralism with the United Nations at
its centre.
With the adoption of the Pact for the Future (resolution 79/1), the Global Digital
Compact (ibid., annex I) and the Declaration on Future Generations (ibid., annex II),
we have committed to a comprehensive set of actions. Yes, reform is needed to make
the system more effective and representative of today’s realities, and we stand ready
to jointly walk through the unlocked door. At the forefront of the Pact, we have
recommitted to the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and international 
law, including international humanitarian law. It is our foundation and the basis of
work we undertake in the three interrelated pillars of the United Nations.
We call on all to uphold these commitments faithfully, now more than ever,
including the condemnation of acts of aggression. To make our world safer and
address the increasingly complex crises, we endeavour to address the root causes of
conflict, notably through prevention and the elaboration of national prevention
strategies to reform the Security Council, adapt United Nations peace operations and
accelerate the implementation of the women and peace and security agenda. Let us
look forward to following up on the Pact’s implementation and call on all to be
ambitious while doing so. Numerous new threats lie ahead of us, in particular in the
area of cybersecurity and the fight against mis- and disinformation. We must act with
greater comprehensiveness. Further, we have heard it at the Summit numerous times:
climate change is a threat amplifier. We were disappointed with the deletion of the
action on climate peace and security and remain committed to move forward on its
agenda.
On sustainable development, climate remains a crucial challenge for present and
future generations. Short-term vision or backtracking was no option. We reaffirm the
Paris Agreement and recommit to the United Arab Emirates consensus, including our
collective pledge to transition away from fossil fuels. Let us recall that the slow pace
of progress also spans tackling environmental degradation. We must strengthen and
build synergies in our international environmental governance. We underline that the
common but differentiated responsibilities are reflected in the strict context of climate
action. The recognition in the Global Digital Compact that digital technologies unlock
new capabilities and opportunities for advancing environmental sustainability is
significant. If we want to ensure that digitalization works for sustainable
development, we must place greater focus on the environmental impacts of
digitalization. We welcome the recognition that sustainable development in all of its
three dimensions is a central goal in itself that applies to all countries and that its
achievement, leaving no one behind, is and always will be a central objective of all
Member States and of multilateralism.
We will spare no effort accelerating the achievement of the Sustainable
Development Goals. The European Union and its member States welcome the level
of ambition to accelerate the ongoing reform of the international financial
architecture. We will continue to support strengthening the voice and representation
of developing countries, mobilizing additional financing that responds to those most
in need. We will support efforts to support developing countries to borrow sustainably
so that they can invest in their long-term development. In that vein, we welcome the
call for the International Monetary Fund to undertake a review of ways to strengthen
and improve the sovereign debt architecture, building on existing international
processes and engaging all relevant stakeholders, including the Secretary-General,
the World Bank, the Group of 20 and major bilateral creditors, as well as debtor
countries in these efforts. The United Nations has an important role to play in global
economic governance, and coordination with international financial institutions that
have independent but complementary mandates will be crucial in achieving a global
system that is more just and fit for purpose.
Regarding digital issues, the adoption of the Global Digital Compact is a
significant step forward in articulating concrete objectives towards bridging all digital
divides between and within countries. We look forward to proposals for innovative
voluntary financing for artificial intelligence capacity-building, understanding that a
global fund on artificial intelligence, as proposed by the High-level Advisory Body
on Artificial Intelligence, is only one potential option. When it comes to the Global
Digital Compact follow-up and review, we call for caution in order to avoid 
duplicating efforts and conversations taking place in other forums, notably in Geneva
and in the Internet Governance Forum. We must ensure complementarity and
synergies across all spaces and proposals.
On human rights, gender and multi-stakeholder engagement, we have fully
recommitted to the universal and indivisible human rights reflected throughout the
Pact, underscoring once more the deep interdependence between human rights,
sustainable development and peace and security. Promoting and protecting all human
rights and fundamental freedoms, including civil, political, economic, social and
cultural rights is a prerequisite for the constant improvement of the well-being and
development of individuals. That is also how we approach the right to development
as an individual right to enable the development of an individual. Let us underline the
crucial role the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights
has to play in the implementation of the Global Digital Compact. In line with its
principles, human rights and the multi-stakeholder approach must be meaningfully
embedded in the set-up of new entities, notably the establishment of an independent
international scientific panel on artificial intelligence and a global dialogue on
artificial intelligence governance. We welcome the need for the Secretary-General to
give his written assessment on the financing of the Office of the United Nations High
Commissioner for Human Rights, and we invite the Secretary-General to present his
findings, including through concrete budget proposals.
We have shown great ambition through our cross-cutting references for the need
for greater gender equality. That ambition must continue as we strive for the full,
equal and meaningful participation of women across forums and processes. In that
context, we must acknowledge that in different cultural, political and social systems,
various forms of family exist and that they must be respectful of, and compatible with,
gender equality and children’s rights. Our ambition to ensure universal access to
sexual and reproductive health for all must be upheld for youth and future generations,
in particular.
Finally, let me conclude by expressing our thanks to the Secretary-General for
convening the Summit of the Future action days. They have showcased that working
with youth, civil society, academia, the technical community and the private sector is
in the fabric of multilateralism. Their role will be indispensable for the
implementation of the Pact and its annexes at the United Nations and beyond. The
European Union stands committed to continuing our efforts to find compromise and
closely cooperating across our continents. We owe it to our people to rebuild trust
among us and to give us new hope.
